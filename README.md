# JSONFormatter
This is a simple editor app that will automatically format a json file when its is loaded.

Most editors will not autoamtically pretty-format a json file unless you add a plugin or some other way that requires effort. After much frustration I decided to write a simple notepad like editor that when a json file is loaded it will automatically pretty-format it. Other than provding an ability to edit the text, that's all it does. No search, relaced etc, etc, very basic.
